Climate Change Impacts 2025 - Data Analysis &amp; Visualization


# 🌍 Climate Change Impacts 2025 - Tableau Dashboard 

This repository provides an in-depth analysis and interactive visualization of climate change impacts across various global regions using **climate, environmental, and socio-economic datasets**. The accompanying **Tableau Dashboard** illustrates these insights through visual storytelling to support better understanding, awareness, and action toward climate resilience.

---

## 📌 Objective

The primary goal of this project is to:
- **Visualize** the wide-ranging effects of climate change
- **Identify trends** in temperature variability, extreme weather, air quality, and economic impact
- **Understand regional vulnerabilities**
- **Support policymakers, researchers, and the public** with data-driven insights

---

## 🔍 Importance of the Study

Climate change is not a future threat — it is a current reality. Rising temperatures, unpredictable weather patterns, and increasing frequency of natural disasters are already affecting ecosystems, economies, and human health. 

This project:
- Highlights **temperature fluctuations**, **air pollution**, and **precipitation intensity**
- Tracks **Extreme Weather Events (EWE)** by region, season, and climate type
- Quantifies the **economic cost** and **infrastructure vulnerability**
- Presents **interactive comparisons** across countries and timeframes

Such a consolidated, visual approach helps in:
- Detecting high-risk zones
- Supporting infrastructure planning
- Informing sustainability-focused decision-making

## 📂 Datasets Used

This project combines multiple datasets into a unified table: `Climate_Change_Combined_Data`. The data sources include:

### 1. Climate Metrics:
- Average Temperature (°C)
- Temperature Variability (°C)
- Precipitation Intensity
- Humidity

### 2. Environmental Indicators:
- Air Quality Index (AQI)
- Extreme Weather Events (EWE) Count

### 3. Socio-Economic Indicators:
- Economic Impact Estimate (USD)
- Infrastructure Vulnerability Score
- Population Exposure

### 4. Geographic Dimensions:
- Country
- City
- Climate Zone (Tropical, Arid, Temperate)
- Season and Month

Each row represents a **monthly aggregated record per city**, merged from climate, weather event, and socio-economic datasets.
